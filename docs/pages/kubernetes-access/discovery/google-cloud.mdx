title: Teleport GKE Auto-Discovery (Preview)
description: How to configure auto-discovery of Google Kubernetes Engine clusters in Teleport.
---

The Teleport Discovery Service can automatically register your Google Kubernetes
Engine (GKE) clusters with Teleport. With Teleport Kubernetes Auto-Discovery,
you can configure the Teleport Kubernetes Service and Discovery Service once,
then create GKE clusters without needing to register them with Teleport after
each creation.  

In this guide, we will show you how to get started with Teleport Kubernetes
Auto-Discovery for GKE.

## Overview

(!docs/pages/kubernetes-access/discovery/includes/step-description.mdx!)

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- A Google Cloud account with permissions to create GKE clusters, IAM roles, and
  service accounts.
- One or more GKE clusters running. Your Kubernetes user must have permissions
  to create `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding` resources in your clusters.
- A Linux host where you will run the Teleport Discovery and Kubernetes
  services. You can run this host on any cloud provider or even use a local
  machine.

(!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/3. Obtain Google Cloud credentials

The Teleport Discovery Service uses a Google Cloud service account to
authenticate to your Google Cloud account and discover GKE clusters. In this
step, you will create a service account and download a credentials file for the
Teleport Discovery Service.

### Create an IAM role

The Teleport Discovery Service needs permissions to access GKE clusters
associated with your Google Cloud project. To grant it these permissions, create
a new IAM role.

Visit the [IAM & Admin](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/roles) page
of the Google Cloud console. Click **Create Role**.

For **Title**, enter `GKE Cluster Discoverer`.

For **ID**, enter `GKEKubernetesAutoDisc`.

Set **Role launch stage** to "General Availability".

Click **Add Permissions** and ensure that you include the following:

- `container.clusters.get`
- `container.clusters.list`

Click **Create**.

### Create a service account

In the Google Cloud console, go to the [Service
Accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) page,
select the project associated with your GKE cluster, and click **Create Service
Account** 

For **Service account name**, enter "Teleport Discovery Service". The Google
Cloud console will suggest an ID similar to `teleport-discovery-service` with a
numberical suffix. We will assume that you are using this service account ID for
the rest of this guide.

Click **Create and Continue**.

### Download a credentials file

Once you create your service account, visit the service account's Keys tab and
create a new key:

{/* TODO: Recreate this image for this guide* }

![Service Account Keys](../../../img/database-access/guides/cloudsql/service-account-keys@2x.png)

Make sure to choose the JSON format:

{/* TODO: Recreate this image if needed*/}
![Service Account New Key](../../../img/database-access/guides/cloudsql/service-account-new-key@2x.png)

Move your credentials file to the host running the Teleport Kubernetes Service
and Discovery Service at the path `/etc/google-cloud-credentials.json`. We will
use this credentials file when running these services later in this guide.

## Step 2/3. Authorize Teleport to discover GKE clusters

To forward requests to the Kubernetes cluster, the Teleport Kubernetes Service 
requires cluster-wide permissions to impersonate RBAC users and groups, to
create `SelfSubjectAccessReviews` and `SelfSubjectRulesReviews`, and, finally,
read access to `Pods`.

To enable this access, define a manifest with the following content in a file
called `teleport-auth.yaml`:


```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: teleport
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - ""
  resources:
  - users
  - groups
  - serviceaccounts
  verbs:
  - impersonate
- apiGroups:
  - ""
  resources:
  - pods
  verbs:
  - get
- apiGroups:
  - "authorization.k8s.io"
  resources:
  - selfsubjectaccessreviews
  - selfsubjectrulesreviews
  verbs:
  - create
---
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: teleport
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: teleport
subjects:
- kind: Group
  name: teleport
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

{/* TODO: Add instructions for shifting context?*/}

Connect to your target cluster with create the following resources using
`kubectl`:

```code
$ kubectl create -f teleport-auth.yaml
```

## Step 3/3. Configure Teleport to discover GKE clusters

### Install Teleport

Install Teleport on the host you are using to run the Kubernetes Service and
Discovery Service.

(!docs/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

### Create a join token 

Teleport Auto-Discovery requires a Teleport join token for the Discovery and
Kubernetes services to join the cluster. Generate one by running the following
command against your Teleport Auth Service and save it in `/tmp/token` on the
machine that will run Kubernetes Auto-Discovery:

```code
$ tctl tokens add --type=discovery,kube
```

### Configure the Kubernetes Service and Discovery Service

On the host running the Kubernetes Service and Discovery Service, create a
Teleport configuration file with the following content at `/etc/teleport.yaml`:

```yaml
version: v2
teleport:
  join_params:
    token_name: "/tmp/token"
    method: token
  auth_servers:
  - "teleport.example.com:3080"
auth_service:
  enabled: off
proxy_service:
  enabled: off
ssh_service:
  enabled: off
discovery_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  gcp:
    - types: ["gke"]
      locations: ["*"]
      project_ids: ["myproject"] # replace with my project ID
      tags: ["*"]
kubernetes_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  resources:
  - labels:
      "*": "*"
```

Replace `teleport.example.com:3080` with the host and port of your Teleport
Proxy Service (e.g., `mytenant.teleport.sh` for Teleport Cloud tenants).

In the `discovery_service` section, replace `myproject` with the ID of your
Google Cloud project.{/* TODO: How do you find this?*/} The `project_ids` field
must include at least one value, and it must not be the wildcard character
(`*`).

Each item in `discovery_service.gcp` is a matcher for Kubernetes clusters in
GKE. Each matcher's `types` field must be set to an array with a single string
value, `gke`. 

The `locations` field contains an array of Google Cloud regions that the
matcher will search for GKE clusters. The wildcard character, `*`, configures
the matcher not to filter by region. {/* TODO: Does this apply to Google Cloud
zones, regions, or both?*/} 

Like `locations`, `tags` consists of an array of strings. A wildcard value
matches all tags in your Google Cloud account. If you include another value,
the matcher will match all GKE clusters with the provided tag. {/* TODO: These
are Google Cloud tags, right, not Teleport tags?*/}

{/* TODO: behavior if there are multiple matchers? Is it OR or AND?*/}

### Start the Kubernetes Service and Discovery Service 

On the host where you will run the Kubernetes Service, execute the following
command, depending on whether you installed Teleport using a package manager or
via a TAR archive:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Package Manager">

When you installed Teleport via package manager, the installation process
configured a systemd service for Teleport. This service reads environment
variables from a file at the path `/etc/default/teleport`.

Run the following command to enable Teleport's built-in Google Cloud client to
read the credentials file for its service account:

```code
$ cat<<EOF | sudo tee /etc/default/teleport
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/etc/google-cloud-credentials.json"
EOF
```

Start the Teleport service:

```code
$ sudo systemctl start teleport
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="TAR archive">
```code
$ export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/etc/google-cloud-credentials.json"
$ sudo -E teleport start
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 4/4. Connect to your GKE cluster

### Allow access to your Kubernetes cluster

Ensure that you are in the correct Kubernetes context for the cluster you would
like to enable access to.

Retrieve all available contexts:

```code
$ kubectl config get-contexts
```

Switch to your context, replacing `CONTEXT_NAME` with the name of your chosen
context:

```code
$ kubectl config use-context CONTEXT_NAME
Switched to context CONTEXT_NAME
```

(!docs/pages/includes/kubernetes-access/rbac.mdx!)

### Access your cluster

Run the following command to list the Kubernetes clusters that your Teleport
userh as access to. The list should now include your GKE cluster:

```code
$ tsh kube ls
```

Log in to your cluster, replacing `mycluster` with the name of a cluster you
listed previously:

```code
$ tsh kube login mycluster
```
